# Refokus

> **Note:** This project is a part of the Sheriyans Coding School **Three.js Domination** course.

## Project Overview

This repository is a clone of [Refokus](https://www.refokus.com/), built as a learning project for the Sheriyans Coding School Three.js Domination course. The goal is to replicate the design, layout, and interactive features of the original Refokus website using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates:

- Responsive layouts and modern UI/UX practices
- Component-driven architecture in React
- Integration of custom fonts and assets
- Use of utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Fast development workflow with Vite

While the original Refokus site uses advanced web technologies and animations, this clone focuses on recreating the core structure and visual style, serving as a hands-on exercise for mastering front-end development skills.

## Features
- React-based UI with reusable components
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Custom fonts integration
- Organized folder structure for scalability
- Vite for fast development and build
